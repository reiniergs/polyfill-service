### Why? The problem


New JavaScript features are being introduced all the time. In many cases, these new features are so helpful we choose to use 
them on production before they’re fully implemented in all browsers. To not break the experience for users on older browsers, 
we of course include polyfills for any not-fully-supported features. Then we might end up unnecessarily penalizes users on 
modern browsers by forcing them to download a lot of code they don’t need.

This is far from ideal. We need a better way to only load polyfills when they are needed.

Also we are gonna write Javascript in the ES6 syntax and since we want to support older browsers
that don’t understand ES6. We need to deal with that. The standard process for that is:

 1. Write ES6 
 2. Compile everything down to ES5 using (e.g. Babel)
 3. Send that to the browser.

Is that the most efficient way? The problem is that we are forcing modern browsers to run old code when they don’t have to. They understand ES6. can not give them ES6?

Note: One thing to be clear Polyfill Service does not provide support for syntactic sugar. For example, Classes, enhanced Object Literals, and things like Arrow Functions. You'd still need a compiler for those.

### A better way

Essentially, what we want from a polyfill delivery system is a way of sending one single copy of each of the best polyfills, in the right order (respecting dependencies), to just the browsers that lack a native implementation. The polyfill service does this by reading the User-Agent HTTP header and then using it to find the list of polyfills that are suitable for that browser and its specific version.

**Note:** Typically once a browser version is released, its feature set does not change until its next release.

### Running Locally

Clone the project onto your local machine:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/reiniergs/polyfill-service.git
```
Change to your cloned project directory
```bash
$ cd polyfill-service
```
Build the project
```
$ mvn clean install
```
 Start the app server
```
$ mvn jetty:run
```
After the server starts up, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to test that it is up
